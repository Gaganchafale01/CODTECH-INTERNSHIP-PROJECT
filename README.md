Project Overview: Battery Management System (BMS) Simulation

Objective
To simulate a Battery Management System (BMS) that monitors and manages key battery parameters such as:
1.State of Charge (SOC)
2.State of Health (SOH)
3.Battery voltage and current
4.Battery temperature (thermal modeling)
The simulation aims to enhance battery safety, longevity, and performance by implementing intelligent monitoring and control algorithms.

Key Activities
1.Design Battery Model
  >Use a simplified RC (resistor-capacitor) model or electrochemical model.
  >Calculate terminal voltage using OCV – I×R.
2.SOC Estimation
  >Implement Coulomb Counting method for SOC calculation.
  >Integrate current over time to estimate charge level.
3.SOH Estimation
  >Compare current battery capacity with nominal capacity.
  >Reflect battery aging over time.
4.Thermal Management Modeling
  >Simulate heat generation using Joule heating (I²R).
  >Estimate battery temperature using thermal resistance.
5.Visualization
  >Generate time-based plots for SOC, SOH, voltage, and temperature.
